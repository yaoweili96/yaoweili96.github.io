My research studies the impacts of changing human emissions and increasing wildfires on atmospheric aerosols in a changing climate, and to understand their feedback on aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions. Specifically, I study the climate and chemical impacts of aerosols in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). UTLS aerosols modulate global radiative balance by scattering and absorbing radiation, as well as affecting the nucleation of ice clouds. Additionally, they affect the protective ozone layer by modulating heterogeneous reaction rates of halogen species on the particle surface. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the properties of UTLS aerosols, including their microphysics, chemical composition, and optical properties. To shed light on UTLS aerosols and their impacts, my research combines field measurements, laboratory studies, satellite remote sensing, rediative transfer models, and aerosol-chemistry-climate modeling.

During the [NASA DCOTSS](https://dcotss.org/) and [NOAA SABRE](https://csl.noaa.gov/projects/sabre/) aircraft missions, I developed and deployed two aircraft instruments to: 1) measure UTLS aerosol concentration and size distribution ([DPOPS instrument](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/instrument/DPOPS)), and 2) collect UTLS aerosol samples for offline chemical composition and morphology analysis (high-altitude aircraft MOUDI system). My work yielded a valuable dataset of aerosol concentration, size distribution, composition, and morphology up to 22 km over North America. This dataset is essential for characterizing background UTLS aerosols and perturbations from volcanic and wildfire injections. For example, my instrument measured volcanic plumes from La Soufri√®re eruptions in April 2021 in the stratosphere, which I used for detailed analysis of their spatiotemporal evolutions and impacts on radiative forcing and ozone. I also evaluated the radiative impacts of high-altitude wildfire smoke measured in the UT.

<!-- Climate change can pose a substantial threat to air quality and human health. For example, extreme drought and heat waves can increase the risk of wildfire and dust storms, leading to excessive levels of health-damaging pollutants. However, most existing climate/health studies focus primarily on the impacts of climate change ignored the substantial channel through climate-induced air pollution changes. Quantitative evidence of how climate change influences air pollution and human health is highly incomplete.

I develop a novel research methodology that integrates causal inference and atmospheric modeling and obtains policy insights that cannot be achieved by any method alone. For example, we used firm-level data and detailed atmospheric chemistry models to assess the effect of an energy policy in China on air quality and found very different results from what researchers would have projected based on process-based models *(Qiu et al., EST, 2020)*. The underlying differences between the data-based evaluations and model-based projections come from the dramatic decline in baseline energy intensity during the studied period in China, and the heterogeneity of policy responses across firms.

Another challenge in evaluating the effects of policies on air quality comes from the variability in meteorological conditions. With insights from a state-of-the-art atmospheric chemistry model, I designed a machine learning-based meteorological correction approach that yields significant improvements over the existing methods. Our method reduces the bias of falsely attributing air quality improvement to emissions changes by over 60% *(Qiu et al., ACP, 2022)*.

**3. Composition dependence of stratospheric aerosol radiative forcing**

<!-- Exposure to air pollution and the associated health burden has been shown to be unequally distributed across populations. My research demonstrates that designing policies to address disparities in exposure to air pollution across population groups, is not straightforward. Focusing on the effects of wind power development on air quality in the US, I showed that developing wind power does not significantly reduce the existing gap of pollution exposure between different population groups, despite its substantial overall benefits on air quality and human health.

**4. Optical properties of organic aerosols**

Policy makers have long been interested in detecting 'high-emitters', a supposedly small fraction of vehicles that make disproportionally large contributions to total fleet emissions. However, existing identification schemes often exclusively rely on snapshot measurements (i.e. emissions within less than a second), and thus simply identify vehicles with high instantaneous emissions, instead of vehicles with high average emissions over a driving period as regulated by emission standards. We design a comprehensive scheme to address this challenge by combining fleetwide remote sensing measurements with detailed second-by-second emission measurements from individual vehicles *(Qiu et al., ERL, 2022)*.  -->
