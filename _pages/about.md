Hello! My name is Yaowei Li (李垚纬). I am currently a [NOAA Climate & Global Change Postdoctoral Fellow](https://cpaess.ucar.edu/cgc/current-awards-alumni), co-hosted by [Prof. Susan Solomon](https://www.ssolomongroup.mit.edu/susansolomon) at MIT and [Prof. Paul Wennberg](https://web.gps.caltech.edu/~wennberg/) at Caltech. 

I received a Ph.D. in [Environmental Science & Engineering](https://seas.harvard.edu/environmental-science-engineering) with [Prof. Frank Keutsch](https://www.keutschgroup.com/home) from Harvard University in 2024. During my Ph.D., I also worked closely with my committee members:  [Prof. Jesse Kroll](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/jesse-kroll/), [Prof. Steve Wofsy](https://atmos.seas.harvard.edu/people/steve-wofsy) and [Prof. Scot Martin](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/scot-t-martin). 

My research focuses on atmospheric chemistry-climate interactions, particularly the climate and chemical impacts of aerosols in both the troposphere and stratosphere. I am approaching these intricate questions through a combination of field and laboratory studies, complemented by tools like radiative transfer model ([RRTMG](http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html)) and box models. I am the Co-PI for the [DPOPS](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/instrument/DPOPS) (optical particle spectrometer) instrument onboard ER-2 aircraft in [NASA DCOTSS mission](https://dcotss.org/) and mini-MOUDI (particle collecting system) instrument onboard WB-57 aircraft in [NOAA SABRE mission](https://csl.noaa.gov/projects/sabre/). I have also participated in the [Munich Urban Air Quality Campaigns](https://www.ee.cit.tum.de/esm/aktuelles/article/enhancing-air-quality-in-munich-real-time-measurements-and-sophisticated-modelling/), where I led the ammonia Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry (NH4+ CIMS) instrument. In the lab, I have been working on: (1) instrumentation for high-altitude aircraft campaigns, (2) optical property measurements of organic aerosols using ellipsometry and FTIR techniques, (3) dynamics of organic gas-particle partitioning at low temperatures using aerosol flow tube and mass spectrometers. 

Prior to Harvard, I received a B.S. in Environmental Sciences and a B.A. in Economics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) (Beijing, China) in 2018. My undergraduate research was advised by [Prof. Qi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QgN0jXcAAAAJ&hl=en) focusing on: (1) chemical characterization of PM1 and PM2.5 in Beijing using aerosol mass spectrometers, (2) development and application of drone-based VOCs sampling system.

Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, volleyball, skiing, and badminton. I am also a cat dad of a British Shorthair (Luna).
