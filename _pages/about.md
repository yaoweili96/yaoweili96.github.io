Hello! My name is Yaowei Li (李垚纬). I am a [PhD student in Environmental Science & Engineering](https://seas.harvard.edu/environmental-science-engineering) at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. At Harvard, I am primamrily advised by [Frank Keutsch](https://www.keutschgroup.com/home). I also worked closely with my committee members:  [Jesse Kroll](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/jesse-kroll/), [Steve Wofsy](https://atmos.seas.harvard.edu/people/steve-wofsy) and [Scot Martin](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/scot-t-martin). I received bachelor degrees in environmental sciences and economics from Peking University in Beijing in 2018. 

My current research focuses on climate and chemical impacts of organic-containing aerosols in the stratosphere and upper troposphere. I am approaching this question using field and laboratory studies, with the aid of radiative transfer model and box model. I am the instrument Co-PI for [DPOPS](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/instrument/DPOPS) (optical particle spectrometer) instrument onboard ER-2 aircraft in [NASA DCOTSS mission](https://dcotss.org/) and mini-MOUDI (particle collecting system) instrument onboard WB-57 aircraft in [NOAA SABRE mission](https://csl.noaa.gov/projects/sabre/). In the lab, I have been working on: 1) instrumentation for high-altitude aircraft campaigns, 2) optical property measurements of organic aerosols using ellipsometry and FTIR techniques, 3) dynamics of organic gas-particle partitioning at low temperatures using flow tube and mass spectrometers. 

I love hiking, skiing, skating, and volleyball.
