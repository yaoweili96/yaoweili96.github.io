Hello! My name is Yaowei Li (李垚纬). I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [Environmental Science & Engineering](https://seas.harvard.edu/environmental-science-engineering) at Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. I am advised by [Prof. Frank Keutsch](https://www.keutschgroup.com/home). I am also working closely with my committee members:  [Prof. Jesse Kroll](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/jesse-kroll/), [Prof. Steve Wofsy](https://atmos.seas.harvard.edu/people/steve-wofsy) and [Prof. Scot Martin](https://eps.harvard.edu/people/scot-t-martin). 

My current research interest is in chemistry-climate interactions focusing on climate and chemical impacts of aerosols in the stratosphere and upper troposphere. I am approaching this question using field and laboratory studies, with the aid of radiative transfer model and box model. I am the Co-PI for [DPOPS](https://airbornescience.nasa.gov/instrument/DPOPS) (optical particle spectrometer) instrument onboard ER-2 aircraft in [NASA DCOTSS mission](https://dcotss.org/) and mini-MOUDI (particle collecting system) instrument onboard WB-57 aircraft in [NOAA SABRE mission](https://csl.noaa.gov/projects/sabre/). In the lab, I have been working on: (1) instrumentation for high-altitude aircraft campaigns, (2) optical property measurements of organic aerosols using ellipsometry and FTIR techniques, (3) dynamics of organic gas-particle partitioning at low temperatures using flow tube and mass spectrometers. 

Prior to Harvard, I received a B.S. in Environmental Sciences and a B.A. in Economics from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) (Beijing, China) in 2018. My undergraduate research was advised by [Prof. Qi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QgN0jXcAAAAJ&hl=en) focusing on: (1) chemical characterization of PM1 and PM2.5 in Beijing using aerosol mass spectrometers, (2) development and application of drone-based VOCs sampling system.

I am a fan of hiking, volleyball, skiing, and badminton. Cat dad of a British Shorthair (Luna).
